                <div>
                  <h2>Concept Overview: </h2>
                  <p>Public smoking zones will be strategically located in high foot traffic areas, such as parks, public squares, or near transport hubs, where smokers can access them without disrupting non-smokers.
                    Access Mechanism: Individuals wishing to use these zones will pay a nominal fee (₹10 for 5 minutes) via a digital payment system or a token machine at the entrance. This fee not only manages the flow of users but also contributes to the maintenance of the zones.
                    Usage Regulation: Each zone will have a set limit on the number of users allowed at any given time, ensuring that air quality and comfort are maintained. Users will be notified when their time is about to expire, encouraging them to be mindful of their smoking habits.
                    
                    <br><br><b></b> <br>The Smoke-Controlled Public Zones aim to designate specific areas for smoking in public spaces, ensuring that smoking occurs in controlled environments equipped with smoke purification technologies.

                    
                    <br><br><b>
                    </b> <br>Mentorship and Guidance: Faculty members provide training and guidance on tree-planting techniques, choosing appropriate species, and ongoing care. They can organize initial workshops to equip students with basic knowledge on plantation and maintenance.
                    Assessment and Evaluation: Faculty monitor the digital logs to ensure each student meets their planting and maintenance requirements. Students’ participation, consistency, and the health of the trees are evaluated as part of their course performance.

                  <h2>Public Health Improvements:

                    </h2>
                  <p>Reduced Exposure: By concentrating smoking in specific areas equipped with air purification technology, the zones significantly reduce secondhand smoke exposure for non-smokers in public spaces.
                    Healthier Environment: Cleaner air in surrounding areas leads to improved public health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with respiratory conditions.
                    Behavioral Changes:
                    
                    <br><br><b></b> <br>Encouraging Responsibility: The nominal access fee promotes responsible smoking behavior, encouraging users to be more mindful of their habits and consider the impact on others.

                    <br><br><b>Community and Institutional Benefits:

                    </b> <br>Awareness Campaigns: The zones can also serve as educational platforms where information about the risks of smoking and benefits of cessation can be shared.
                    Environmental Protection:
                    
                    Sustainable Practices: The initiative aligns with broader environmental goals by minimizing pollution in public areas, contributing to cleaner urban environments.

                  <p>Filtration Systems: Each smoking zone will be equipped with state-of-the-art HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters and activated carbon filters. These systems work by:
                    HEPA Filters: Capturing fine particulate matter, including smoke particles, allergens, and other pollutants.
                    Activated Carbon Filters: Adsorbing gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in tobacco smoke, effectively neutralizing harmful substances.
                    Chemical Scrubbers: In addition to traditional filtration, advanced chemical scrubbers may be used to treat smoke with chemical reactions that break down toxic components, ensuring cleaner air is released back into the environment.

                </h2>
                  <p>Air Quality Monitoring: LLaMA AI can analyze data from air quality sensors placed in designated smoking zones to detect harmful pollutant levels. It could trigger notifications or air filtration systems when air quality deteriorates.
                    Predictive Models for Usage Patterns: LLaMA AI can learn from usage data, predicting peak times and helping manage occupancy, cleaning schedules, and filtration needs more effectively.
                    <br><br><b>Behavioral Analysis & Insights:
                    </b> <br>Tracking Smoking Patterns: By analyzing user data, LLaMA AI could detect trends in smoking frequency, preferred times, and locations. This information could then be used to design better placement and management of smoking zones and adapt policies to reduce usage over time.
                    Impact Prediction: Using climate and health datasets, the AI could project the health and environmental benefits of reduced smoking, offering data-driven insights to policymakers.
